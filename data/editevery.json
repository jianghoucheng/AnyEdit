        "answer": "To find the sum of 100 consecutive odd numbers starting from 1, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nSince we are looking for the sum of 100 consecutive odd numbers starting from 1, the first term (a1) is 1, and the number of terms (n) is 100.\n\nTo find the last term (an), we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nwhere d is the common difference between the terms. For odd numbers, the common difference is 2 (since each odd number is 2 more than the previous odd number).\n\nSo, the last term (an) is:\n\nan = 1 + (100 - 1) * 2\nan = 1 + 99 * 2\nan = 1 + 198\nan = 199\n\nNow we can find the sum:\n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\nSum = 100/2 * (1 + 199)\nSum = 50 * 200\nSum = 10000\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 100 consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 is 10,000.",

        "answer": "To find the largest three-digit number divisible by 6, we need to find the largest three-digit number that is divisible by both 2 and 3, since 6 is the product of 2 and 3.\n\nThe largest three-digit number is 999. To find the largest number divisible by 6, we need to find the closest number to 999 that is divisible by 6.\n\nTo check if 999 is divisible by 6, we can check if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n999 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number. So we need to find the next even number below 999, which is 998.\n\nNow we need to check if 998 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 998 is 9 + 9 + 8 = 26. Since 26 is not divisible by 3, 998 is not divisible by 6.\n\nWe then move to the next even number below 998, which is 996.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 996 is 9 + 9 + 6 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3, 996 is divisible by 3.\n\nSince 996 is both even and divisible by 3, it is divisible by 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit number divisible by 6 is 996.",

        "answer": "To find the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 200, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The odd numbers in this range form an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The first term (a_1) is 1, and the last term (a_n) is 199 (since 200 is even, we don't include it).\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nwhere S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of terms (n). Since the sequence is 1, 3, 5, ..., 199, we can find n by taking the last term, subtracting the first term, dividing by the common difference (2), and then adding 1.\n\nn = (199 - 1)/2 + 1\nn = 198/2 + 1\nn = 99 + 1\nn = 100\n\nNow we have 100 terms. We can plug this into the sum formula:\n\nS_n = 100/2 * (1 + 199)\nS_n = 50 * 200\nS_n = 10000\n\nSo, the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 200 is 10,000.",

However, we are not given the face value of the stock, so we'll assume it to be $100, which is a common face value for stocks.

        "answer": "To find the market value of the stock, we can use the following formula:\n\nMarket Value = (Annual Dividend / Yield) * 100\n\nFirst, we need to determine the annual dividend. Since the stock is a 4% stock, this means that the annual dividend is 4% of the face value (also known as the par value) of the stock. However, we are not given the face value of the stock, so we'll assume it to be $100, which is a common face value for stocks.\n\nAnnual Dividend = (4/100) * $100 = $4\n\nNext, we are given that the stock yields 5%. This yield is the annual dividend expressed as a percentage of the market value of the stock.\n\nYield = (Annual Dividend / Market Value) * 100\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the market value:\n\nMarket Value = (Annual Dividend / Yield) * 100\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nMarket Value = ($4 / 5%) * 100\nMarket Value = ($4 / 0.05) * 100\nMarket Value = $80\n\nTherefore, the market value of the stock is $80.",

        "answer": "To find the mean of the given numbers, we first need to understand the notation used. The \"^\" symbol typically denotes exponentiation, so we need to calculate the value of each term and then find the average.\n\nHowever, the sequence provided seems to be a mix of numbers and exponentiation without clear separation. If we assume that each \"^\" symbol is meant to represent exponentiation and that the sequence is meant to be read as individual exponentiations, we would have:\n\n1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1^2 = 1\n2^2 = 4\n3^2 = 9\n4^2 = 16\n5^2 = 25\n6^2 = 36\n7^2 = 49\n2 = 2 (this last term does not have an exponent, so it remains 2)\n\nNow, we add all these values together:\n\n1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 2 = 142\n\nThere are 8 terms in total, so to find the mean, we divide the sum by the number of terms:\n\nMean = 142 / 8 = 17.75\n\nSo, the mean of the given sequence is 17.75.",

        "answer": "To find the remainder when 5^100 is divided by 18, we can use modular arithmetic.\n\nFirst, let's find the pattern of remainders when powers of 5 are divided by 18.\n\n5^1 \u2261 5 (mod 18)\n5^2 \u2261 25 \u2261 7 (mod 18)\n5^3 \u2261 5 * 7 \u2261 35 \u2261 17 (mod 18)\n5^4 \u2261 5 * 17 \u2261 85 \u2261 13 (mod 18)\n5^5 \u2261 5 * 13 \u2261 65 \u2261 11 (mod 18)\n5^6 \u2261 5 * 11 \u2261 55 \u2261 1 (mod 18)\n\nNotice that 5^6 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 18. This means that every power of 5 that is a multiple of 6 will also give a remainder of 1 when divided by 18.\n\nSince 100 is not a multiple of 6, we need to find the highest multiple of 6 that is less than 100, which is 96 (6 * 16 = 96). Then we can express 5^100 as (5^96) * (5^4).\n\nWe already know that 5^96 will give a remainder of 1 when divided by 18.

        "question": "The radius of a semi-circle is 35 cm. What is its perimeter?",
        "answer": "To find the perimeter of a semi-circle, we need to add the length of the curved part (half of the circumference of a full circle) to the length of the diameter (which is twice the radius).\n\nFirst, let's find the circumference of a full circle using the formula:\nCircumference (C) = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 35 cm, the circumference of the full circle would be:\nC = 2 * \u03c0 * 35 cm\n\nNow, since we only need half of the circumference for the semi-circle, we divide this by 2:\nHalf Circumference = \u03c0 * 35 cm\n\nNext, we find the diameter, which is twice the radius:\nDiameter (d) = 2 * radius = 2 * 35 cm = 70 cm\n\nFinally, we add the half circumference and the diameter to get the perimeter of the semi-circle:\nPerimeter = Half Circumference + Diameter\nPerimeter = \u03c0 * 35 cm + 70 cm\n\nUsing the approximate value of \u03c0 as 3.14, we get:\nPerimeter \u2248 3.14 * 35 cm + 70 cm\nPerimeter \u2248 109.9 cm + 70 cm\nPerimeter \u2248 179.9 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the semi-circle is approximately 179.9 cm.",

To find the remainder, we can either subtract 763 * 131 from 99999 or simply take the decimal part of the division and multiply it by 131:\n\nRemainder = 99999 - (763 * 131)\nRemainder = 99999 - 99973\nRemainder = 26\n\nNow, we subtract the remainder from the largest 5-digit number to get the largest 5-digit number that is exactly divisible by 131:\n\nLargest 5-digit number exactly divisible by 131 = 99999 - 26\nLargest 5-digit number exactly divisible by 131 = 99973\n\nSo, 99973 is the largest 5-digit number that is exactly divisible by 131.",

        "answer": "To solve for (7x + 4y) / (x - 2y), we first need to find the values of x and y from the given equation:\n\nx^2 / \u221a(2y) = 3 / 2\n\nLet's solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx^2 = (3/2) * \u221a(2y)\nx^2 = (3\u221a2/2) * \u221ay\nx^2 = (3\u221a2/2) * y^(1/2)\n\nNow, let's square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n(x^2)^2 = ((3\u221a2/2) * y^(1/2))^2\nx^4 = (9 * 2 / 4) * y\nx^4 = (18/4) * y\nx^4 = (9/2) * y\n\nNow we have an expression for x^4 in terms of y. However, we need x and y separately to plug into the original expression (7x + 4y) / (x - 2y). Since we have x^4 and not x, we cannot directly find the values of x and y from the given equation.\n\nWe need another equation to solve for x and y. Since we are not given any other equation, we cannot find the exact numerical values of x and y. Therefore, we cannot solve for (7x + 4y) / (x - 2y) with the information provided. We would need an additional equation relating x and y to solve for the values of x and y and then substitute them into the expression (7x + 4y) / (x - 2y).",

        "answer": "To find out how many 7/12 portions are in a 23 5/6 mixture, we first need to convert the mixed number into an improper fraction.\n\n23 5/6 can be converted as follows:\n23 whole parts can be expressed as 23 * 6/6 (since 6/6 is equal to 1) to keep the same denominator as the fractional part. So, 23 * 6/6 = 138/6.\n\nNow, add the fractional part 5/6 to the whole part:\n138/6 + 5/6 = 143/6.\n\nNow we have the mixture expressed as an improper fraction: 143/6.\n\nNext, we need to divide this fraction by the portion size, which is 7/12. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 7/12 is 12/7.\n\nSo, we multiply 143/6 by 12/7:\n(143/6) * (12/7) = (143 * 12) / (6 * 7) = 1716 / 42.\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n1716 / 42 = 40.8571428571...\n\nSince we are looking for whole portions, we can only count the full 7/12 portions in the mixture.

To determine the oxidation state of the sulfur atom, we need to consider the oxidation states of the other elements in the compound.\n\nSodium (Na) is an alkali metal and has an oxidation state of +1. Since there are two sodium atoms, the total oxidation state for sodium in the compound is +2.\n\nOxygen (O) typically has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are four oxygen atoms, the total oxidation state for oxygen in the compound is -8.\n\nNow, let's denote the oxidation state of sulfur as x. According to the oxidation state rules, the sum of the oxidation states of all elements in a neutral compound should be equal to zero. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(+2) + x + (-8) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 6 = 0\nx = +6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom in Na2SO4 is +6.",

        "answer": "In N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), the oxidation state of nitrogen can be determined by considering the overall charge of the compound and the oxidation state of oxygen.\n\nThe overall charge of N2O5 is 0, as it is a neutral molecule.

In N2O5, there are five oxygen atoms, each with an oxidation state of -2, which gives a total oxidation state of -10 for all the oxygen atoms combined.\n\nSince there are two nitrogen atoms in N2O5, let's represent the oxidation state of each nitrogen atom as x. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in the molecule should equal the overall charge of the molecule, which is 0 in this case.\n\nSo, the equation can be set up as:\n\n2x + (-10) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nThus, the oxidation state of nitrogen in N2O5 is +5.",

        "answer": "The molecular geometry of H2O (water) is bent or angular. This is because water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the oxygen atom is at the center with the two hydrogen atoms bonded to it. The oxygen atom also has two lone pairs of electrons, which repel the bonded hydrogen atoms, causing the bent shape.\n\nAs for polarity, H2O is a polar molecule. This is due to the difference in electronegativity between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, which means it attracts electrons more strongly. This causes an uneven distribution of electron density, resulting in a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges on the hydrogen atoms. The bent molecular geometry further contributes to the polarity, as the dipole moments of the O-H bonds do not cancel each other out, leading to an overall molecular dipole moment.",

In this configuration, there are 5 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals.\n\nThe magnetic moment (\u03bc) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03bc = \u221a(n(n+2)) \u03bc_B\n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons, and \u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nFor Fe(III) with 5 unpaired electrons:\n\n\u03bc = \u221a(5(5+2)) \u03bc_B\n\u03bc = \u221a(5(7)) \u03bc_B\n\u03bc = \u221a(35) \u03bc_B\n\nThe magnetic moment of FeCl3 is approximately \u221a(35) \u03bc_B or 5.92 \u03bc_B.",

        "question": "What is the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4NO3?",
        "answer": "Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) consists of two ions: the ammonium ion (NH4+) and the nitrate ion (NO3-). To determine the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4NO3, we need to find the oxidation state of nitrogen in each ion separately.\n\n1. In the ammonium ion (NH4+):\nHydrogen has an oxidation state of +1. Since there are four hydrogen atoms, the total positive charge from hydrogen is +4. To balance the overall charge of the ion, the oxidation state of nitrogen (N) in NH4+ must be -3.\n\n2. In the nitrate ion (NO3-):\nOxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Since there are three oxygen atoms, the total negative charge from oxygen is -6. To balance the overall charge of the ion, the oxidation state of nitrogen (N) in NO3- must be +5.\n\nSo, in NH4NO3, nitrogen has two different oxidation states: -3 in the ammonium ion (NH4+) and +5 in the nitrate ion (NO3-).",

        "answer": "NH4NO3 is composed of two ions: NH4+ (ammonium) and NO3- (nitrate). To find the oxidation state of nitrogen in NH4NO3, we need to determine the oxidation state of nitrogen in each ion separately.\n\nIn the NH4+ ion, nitrogen is bonded to four hydrogen atoms.
